Developed hybrid mobile application using flutter framework

To create a hybrid mobile application with flutter, I installed the git, Flutter SDK, Android Studio. 
Inside Android Studio i used dart and flutter plugins and created a project. 
I included 2 plugins,
* contact 
* image picker

1. Contact Picker Plugin:
   This plugin provides a way to access the contacts list and pick a contact from it. 
   It can be used to select a contact from the device's address book and retrieve information such as the contact's name and phone number.

2. Image Picker Plugin:
   This plugin provides a way to pick an image from the device's photo library, or take a new photo with the camera. 
   It can be used to select an image from the device and retrieve information about the selected image, such as its size, dimensions, and filename.

The first i created the UI of the app. This involves designing the various screens, such as the home screen, contact screen, and image picker screen. 

I used the Flutter framework to compile the app and test it on an emulator.

I used Virtual Device Manager tool in Android Studio to create, manage, and run virtual device in Android Studio
